- question: How do I book a tour with Mifras?
  answer: >
    The easiest way is to send me a WhatsApp message — I respond quickly and we can
    discuss your requirements, dates, and budget directly. You can also use the contact
    form on this website. I don't require a booking platform or third-party agency;
    everything is arranged directly between us.

- question: Do you speak English?
  answer: >
    Yes — I speak fluent English, as well as Sinhala and Tamil. Many of my clients
    are from the UK, USA, Australia, and Europe, so clear English communication is
    something I'm proud of and practise every day.

- question: What type of vehicle do you use?
  answer: >
    I use a well-maintained, air-conditioned Toyota KDH Van for groups of 3 or more,
    and a comfortable sedan car for couples and solo travellers. Both vehicles are
    clean, insured, and equipped with phone chargers and a first-aid kit.

- question: What is your pricing structure?
  answer: >
    Pricing depends on the type of trip, duration, and distance. Sample starting
    prices are shown on the Services page. I charge a transparent daily or per-trip
    rate — no hidden fees. Entry ticket costs (e.g. Sigiriya, Yala) are separate
    and paid directly at the sites. Please WhatsApp me for a personalised quote.

- question: Do I need to pay in advance?
  answer: >
    A small deposit (typically 20–30%) is requested to confirm longer bookings.
    Airport transfers are usually pay-on-arrival. I accept cash (LKR or USD) and
    can also arrange payment via bank transfer. We'll discuss the details over WhatsApp.

- question: Can you recommend accommodation?
  answer: >
    Absolutely — I've stayed or dropped guests at dozens of guesthouses, boutique
    hotels, and eco-lodges across Sri Lanka. I'm happy to recommend options at
    every budget level. I don't take commissions, so my suggestions are genuinely
    based on quality and value.

- question: Do you drive at night?
  answer: >
    I generally avoid long-distance night driving for safety reasons, but short
    evening transfers within cities or towns are fine. Most itineraries are designed
    so that driving happens during daylight hours for both safety and scenery.

- question: Is Sri Lanka safe for solo female travellers?
  answer: >
    Sri Lanka is generally a safe destination, and I take the safety and comfort
    of solo female travellers especially seriously. I can suggest safe, reputable
    accommodation and local contacts, and I'll always make sure you're settled
    before I leave each evening.

- question: What happens if my flight is delayed?
  answer: >
    I track your flight in real time. If your flight is delayed, I'll adjust my
    pick-up time accordingly at no extra charge. Just send me your flight number
    when booking and I'll take care of the rest.

- question: Can we adjust the itinerary on the fly?
  answer: >
    Definitely — that's one of the biggest advantages of a private driver over a
    group tour. If you discover somewhere you'd love to spend more time, or want to
    skip a planned stop, just let me know. It's your holiday and your pace.

- question: Do you arrange safaris and national park visits?
  answer: >
    Yes. For parks like Yala, Minneriya, and Udawalawe I can arrange the jeep safari
    separately (required by park regulations) and coordinate the booking on your behalf.
    I'll drop you at the park entrance and meet you afterward.

- question: What is the best time to visit Sri Lanka?
  answer: >
    Sri Lanka has two monsoon seasons affecting different coasts. December–March
    is ideal for the south and west coasts, plus the Cultural Triangle. April–September
    suits the east coast and hill country. I can advise on the best routing based
    on your travel dates — just ask!
